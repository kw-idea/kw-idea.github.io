    abstract = {This study examines the usability of communication-assistive applications for hearing-impaired users, with a focus on enhancing user experience and promoting social inclusion. Although such applications have been developed and evaluated previously, interface designs that consider the intimacy needs of hearing-impaired users remain under-explored. We performed a comprehensive usability evaluation employing a mixed-method approach, which involved hearing-impaired individuals as well as field experts. The findings revealed areas for improvement in the design, validated the feasibility of implementing these applications, and emphasized the importance of incorporating the unique needs and preferences of hearing-impaired users. Furthermore, this paper discusses the importance of introducing guidelines and evaluation scales for the “Design for Emotion and Life Knowledge” levels to facilitate smooth and effective human–computer interactions. Such measures will promote the development of intelligent assistive technologies that reflect the qualitative needs of people with disabilities and contribute to social rights for hearing-impaired users. With the growing demands of artificial-intelligence-powered assistive technologies, the inclusion of individuals with disabilities in the design and research process is anticipated to increase. In future, studies should be conducted to blend the culturally shared experiences and emotional bonds expressed by users (having mild-to-severe hearing impairment) with the design and development process of assistive devices or services.},

ABSTRACT = {This study introduces a framework that integrates business analytics into educational decision-making to improve learner engagement and performance in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), focusing on learning environments in English as a Foreign Language (EFL). By examining three specific research questions, this paper delineates patterns in learner engagement, evaluates factors that affect these patterns, and examines the relationship between these factors and educational outcomes. The study provides an empirical analysis that elucidates the connection between learner behaviors and learning outcomes by employing machine learning, process mining, and statistical methods such as hierarchical clustering, process discovery, and the Mann-Kendall test. The analysis determines that learning patterns, characterized as single-phase or multi-phase, repetitive or non-repetitive, and sequential or self-regulated, are more closely associated with the nature of the educational content—such as books, series, or reading levels—than learner characteristics. Furthermore, it has been observed that learners exhibiting self-regulated learning patterns tend to achieve superior academic outcomes. The findings advocate for integrating analytics in educational practices, offer strategic insights for educational enhancements, and propose a new perspective on the connection between learner behavior and educational success.},

ABSTRACT = {Facial expression recognition technology has been utilized both for entertainment purposes and as a valuable aid in rehabilitation and facial exercise assistance. This technology leverages artificial intelligence models to predict facial landmark points and provide visual feedback, thereby facilitating users' facial movements. However, feedback designs that disregard user preferences may cause discomfort and diminish the benefits of exercise. This study aimed to develop a feedback design guide for facial rehabilitation exercises by investigating user responses to various feedback design methods. We created a facial recognition mobile application and designed six feedback variations based on shape and transparency. To evaluate user experience, we conducted a usability test involving 48 participants (24 subjects in their 20s and 24 over 60 years of age), assessing factors such as feedback, assistance, disturbance, aesthetics, cognitive ease, and appropriateness. The experimental results revealed significant differences in transparency, age, and the interaction between transparency and age. Consequently, it is essential to consider both transparency and user age when designing facial recognition feedback. The findings of this study could potentially inform the design of more effective and personalized visual feedback for facial motion, ultimately benefiting users in rehabilitation and exercise contexts.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite active research on the design of presentation tools after the emergence of slideshow presentations, there is a lack of research findings on appropriate modalities of interactions for controlling slides in an exploratory manner. The objective of this study is to find the appropriate modality for features of controlling slides and to design usable features. This study used an iterative design process based on the Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) prototype and participatory design (PD), which was divided into three phases. In the first phase, the participants were directly involved in the ideation process, and they created an initial design set. In the second phase, the initial prototype was evaluated by the participants with WoZ, focusing on the scope of co-speech gesture interactions. Finally, the usability of the final design set was evaluated, and it was demonstrated that the proposed design features were usable in terms of naturalness, controllability, efficiency of information delivery, and efficiency of resource use. The results also showed that verbal modality was more dominant, while many previous studies focused on creating gesture-based systems. This research is expected to provide guidance for designing a hand-free presentation with a co-speech gesture, and benefits for conducting PD research with WoZ.},

abstract = {The lane keeping assistance system, a representative advanced driver assistance system, comprises a shared control that cooperates with the driver to achieve a common goal. The steering experience of the driver may vary significantly depending on the auto-steering control strategy of the system. In this study, we examined the driving experience with various steering control strategies. Nine control strategies (three torque amounts x three deviations in starting control) were established as prototypes. Eighteen drivers participated in the evaluation of each strategy in a highway environment on a driving simulator. A two-way repeated measure ANOVA was used to assess the effects of the system. Both the objective measures (standard deviation of lane position, steering reversal rate, and root mean square of lateral speed) and subjective measures (pleasure and arousal of emotion, trust, disturbance, and satisfaction) were evaluated and analyzed. The results showed that a torque amount of 3 Nm evoked feelings of high disturbance and negative emotional responses. A deviation in starting control (DEV) of 0.80 m yielded unstable lane keeping performances and evoked negative effects on pleasure, trust, and satisfaction. A regression model for the driver satisfaction recommended a torque of 2.32 Nm and a DEV of 0.27 m as the optimal design parameters. This proposed strategy is expected to improve the experience design of lateral semi-autonomous vehicles.}

abstract="Background: Patients with parkinsonism have higher inactivity levels than the general population, and this results in increased comorbidities. Although exercise has benefits for motor function and quality of life (QOL) in patients with parkinsonism, these patients face many barriers to exercise participation, such as lack of motivation, fatigue, depression, and time constraints. Recently, the use of mobile apps has been highlighted as a remote exercise management strategy for patients with chronic diseases. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of home-based exercise management with a customized mobile app on the exercise amount, physical activity, and QOL of patients with parkinsonism. Methods: This was a prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study. The therapist installed the app in the smartphones of the participants and educated them on how to use the app. The therapist developed an individualized multimodal exercise program that consisted of stretching, strengthening, aerobic, balance and coordination, and oral-motor and vocal exercises. Participants were encouraged to engage in an 8-week home-based exercise program delivered through a customized app. The alarm notifications of the app provided reminders to exercise regularly at home. The primary outcome was the exercise amount. The secondary outcomes were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The usability of the customized app was assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Results: A total of 21 participants with parkinsonism completed the intervention and assessment between September and December 2020 (mean age: 72 years; women: 17/21, 81{\%}; men: 4/21, 19{\%}). The participants reported a significant increase in the total amount of exercise (baseline: mean 343.33, SD 206.70 min/week; 8-week follow-up: mean 693.10, SD 373.45 min/week; P<.001) and in the amount of each exercise component, including stretching, strengthening, balance and coordination, and oral-motor and vocal exercise after 8 weeks. Analysis of the secondary outcomes revealed significant improvements in the IPAQ (P=.006), PDQ-39 (P=.02), and GDS (P=.04) scores. The usability of the program with the mobile app was verified based on the positive responses such as ``intention to use'' and ``role expectation for rehabilitation.'' Conclusions: Exercise management with a customized mobile app may be beneficial for improving exercise adherence, physical activity levels, depression management, and QOL in patients with parkinsonism. This remotely supervised technology-based, reinforcing, and multimodal exercise management strategy is recommended for use in patients with parkinsonism. In addition, this program proved useful as an alternative exercise management strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic when patients with Parkinson disease were less physically active than before and showed aggravation of symptoms. However, additional clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this exercise program in a large population and to confirm its disease-modifying effects. ",

abstract = {Recognizing learners' motivational problems in online remote learning, this study examined the patterns of learner's academic emotions and facial expressions detected in asynchronous video-based learning. The research questions of this are: (1) What are the patterns between facial expressions and negative emotions (i.e., boredom, confusion, and frustration) that learners experienced during online video-based learning? (2) What are the learner's overall perceptions about their emotions during online video-based learning? This study was conducted with 26 Korean adult learners who took an online video lecture via an asynchronous self-directed mode. Their facial expressions during online learning were recorded and analyzed for detecting affective states. Two judges trained in Ekman's Facial Action Coding System (FACS) analyzed 210 scenes segmented from the recorded video data using a retrospective affect judgment procedure. The analysis identified 101 incidences of boredom, 82 confusions, and 62 frustrations. Moreover, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and hierarchical clustering, we identified some patterns of significant relationships between facial action units and affective states. The interview data reveal that the potential reasons for negative emotions include lack of concentration, uninteresting content, and one-way content delivery method. Given the massive transition to online video-based learning during and after COVID-19, the results of this study can provide implications concerning how to detect and intervene in potential issues associated with learner's motivation and affective states.}

    abstract = { A shared control system has received steady attention as it can mitigate or avoid potential weaknesses of autonomous driving. According to the preliminary study, the drivers' experience was found to change significantly depending on the system's intervention strategy. In particular, driver satisfaction was found to decrease significantly due to the feeling of disturbance or interference. In this study, a strategy was suggested to adjust the haptic authority according to human torque to minimize the feeling of disturbance. Twelve control strategies were designed as a prototype to investigate their effects on the driver's experience. As a result, a positive effect on the driving experience was observed by providing adequate torque reduction. Based on the regression model of satisfaction, optimal design parameters were derived. The results of this study are expected to contribute to designing more favorable control strategy of a shared steering control system. }

In this study, the effects of button size, spacing, and operation method on the usability of virtual buttons in VR environments were investigated. Task completion time, number of errors, and subjective preferences were collected to test different levels of the button size, spacing, and operation method. The experiment was conducted in a desktop setting with Oculus Rift and Leap motion. A total of 18 subjects performed a button selection task. The optimal levels of button size and spacing within the experimental conditions are 25 mm and between 5 mm and 9 mm, respectively. Button sizes of 15 mm with 1-mm spacing were too small to be used in VR environments. A trend of decreasing task completion time and the number of errors was observed as button size and spacing increased. However, large size and spacing may cause fatigue, due to continuous extension of the arms. For operation method, the touch method took a shorter task completion time. However, the push method recorded a smaller number of errors, owing to the visual push-feedback. In this paper, we discuss advantages and disadvantages in detail. The results can be applied to many different application areas with VR HMD using virtual hand interaction.}

We conducted this study in two phases: a user study (Phase I) and a heuristic walkthrough (Phase II). In Phase I, we conducted a user study with three university students with visual impairments to identify their needs and the barriers to learning that they encounter in mobile MOOC platforms. In Phase II, five evaluators conducted a heuristic walkthrough based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (World Wide Web Consortium, 2008) to examine the degree of accessibility of a MOOC platform. Overall, the results indicate that serious accessibility issues exist in MOOC platforms, preventing learners with visual impairments from fully participating in learning activities.

abstract = {Although the automotive industry has been among the sectors that best-understands the importance of drivers’ affect, the focus of design and research in the automotive field has long emphasized the visceral aspects of exterior and interior design. With the adoption of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), endowing ‘semi-autonomy’ to the vehicles, however, the scope of affective design should be expanded to include the behavioural aspects of the vehicle. In such a ‘shared-control’ system wherein the vehicle can intervene in the human driver’s operations, a certain degree of ‘intrusive feelings’ are unavoidable. For example, when the Lane Keeping Assistance System (LKAS), one of the most popular examples of ADAS, operates the steering wheel in a dangerous situation, the driver may feel interrupted or surprised because of the abrupt torque generated by LKAS. This kind of unpleasant experience can lead to prolonged negative feelings such as irritation, anxiety, and distrust of the system. Therefore, there are increasing needs of investigating the driver’s affective responses towards the vehicle’s dynamic behaviour. In this study, four types of intrusive feelings caused by LKAS were identified to be proposed as a quantitative performance indicator in designing the affectively satisfactory behaviour of LKAS. A metric as well as a statistical data analysis method to quantitatively measure the intrusive feelings through the vehicle sensor log data.}
